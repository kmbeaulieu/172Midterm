# 172Midterm
fall 2016 midterm code

Unworking code: 
1) check validity needs something synchronous to make the current code work. 
At the moment it lets all currencies pass but it will give an undefined if you try to do a bad currency on the buy output.

2) no csv write out yet. fast csv is downloaded to do this but no implementation yet.

3) minor changes like changing all lowercase to uppercase for buy/sell/currency
